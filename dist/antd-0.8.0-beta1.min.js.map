Let's the build system minify keys\n * without loosing the ability to dynamically use key strings as values\n * themselves. Pass in an object with a single key/val pair and it will return\n * you the string key of that single record. Suppose you want to grab the\n * value for a key 'className' inside of an object. Key/val minification may\n * have aliased that key to be 'xa12'. keyOf({className: null}) will return\n * 'xa12' in that case. Resolve keys you want to use once at startup time, then\n * reuse those resolutions.\n */\nvar keyOf = function(oneKeyObj) {\n  var key;\n  for (key in oneKeyObj) {\n    if (!oneKeyObj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n      continue;\n    }\n    return key;\n  }\n  return null;\n};\n\n\nmodule.exports = keyOf;\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/react/lib/keyOf.js\n ** module id = 163\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, '__esModule', {\n  value: true\n});\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { 'default': obj }; }\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _classnames = require('classnames');\n\nvar _classnames2 = _interopRequireDefault(_classnames);\n\nvar getDotCount = function getDotCount(spec) {\n  var dots;\n  dots = Math.ceil(spec.slideCount / spec.slidesToScroll);\n  return dots;\n};\n\nvar Dots = _react2['default'].createClass({\n  displayName: 'Dots',\n\n  clickHandler: function clickHandler(options, e) {\n    // In Autoplay the focus stays on clicked button even after transition\n    // to next slide.
